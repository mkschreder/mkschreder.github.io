UBUS JSON Server
===

During my research into how to better interface websocket interface I was
developing for [JUCI project](juci-project.html) I developed this small server
that was designed to accept JSON requests through a normal socket and then pass
them to the ubus server. It was since replaced by
[JUCID](revorpcd-project.html) which provides a much more robust and secure way
to achive the same effect.  

I do not plan to develop this project further any time soon so it serves as a
mere code example.
