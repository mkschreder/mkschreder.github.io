Martin K. Schröder

I'm a consultant working with embedded linux platforms (I currently work with
OpenWRT platform). I have been professionally working with software development
since 2006, but my interest with electronics and programming dates much further
in time. Throughout my projects I almost predominantly use linux as my prefered
programming environment. 

Below are some of my work that you will find here on my github pages.

License
===

Most of my code and media files are distributed under the GPLv3
license. GPLv3 license is chosen as the license that is most compatible with
other OpenSource licenses, removing a lot of ambiguity of previous GPLv2
license. All of my work which I create myself is copyright Martin Schröder,
however since it given to you under the GPL, there is nothing stopping you from
using my work in a commercial product. I do not dual-license my existing work
under any other license than that which is specified in individual project
readme.
