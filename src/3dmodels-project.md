3D Modeling and Product Design
===

During the period between 2011 and 2013 I have been selling security doors and
this repository includes some of the models that I have created in blender both
as marketing material and also as drawings that we would then send to the
factory to manufacture the doors. Imagine that, I'm just a programmer and I
would design a door in blender and then it would end up in someones doorway.
Luckily I did not have to build the product myself because that would have been
a disaster :-). It was a business I started because I thought it was a good
idea at the time. I was really excited about it. 

I hated it more over the years though because I did not have time to do
programming and had to sell doors instead. So I actually ended up doing OpenERP
coding, website development and 3d modelling during that time which were the
tasks I enjoyed most with that business. Eventually I just realized that it was
a completely wrong type of business for me and let it go. 

Some of the media I created during that time is still around though.
