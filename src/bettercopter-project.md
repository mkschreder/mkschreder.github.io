BetterCopter
===

During the time of the end of 2014 to beginning of 2015 I was greatly
fascinated with quadcopters and programming of microcontrollers. When I created
the [libk](libk-project.html) I also created bettercopter as an application
example for building a quadcopter flight controller firmware based on libk. I
eventually did other things in 2015, so I never finished this project. 

Bettercopter was my first venture into the world of quadcopters and into the
mechanics behind them. I prefer to see it as a leraning experience.
