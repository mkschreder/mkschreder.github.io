JUCI WebGUI Project
====

I developed JUCI project as a better alternative to existing LuCI gui available
on OpenWRT. JUCI is designed to make developing web based interfaces for
embedded devices simpler, quicker and with much greater artistic control than
is usually possible. It is developed using modular javascript with HTML5 and
uses AngularJS platform for connecting all components together.  

	JUCI project was originally developed for Inteno Broadband Technology and
	Inteno's IOPSYS based systems. Since 2016 Inteno is maintaining their own
	half-proprietary "Inteno" version of JUCI which works on IOPSYS systems, while
	the main JUCI project has been cleaned up to only include code that is of
	generic nature and works well on stock OpenWRT systems. If you are
	interested in IOPSYS systems, you can contact Inteno. If you just want to
	use JUCI in your own OpenWRT based project then contact me or follow the
	links below.
